# webpack-migrate-poc

## Overview
This repository is for testing and documenting **webpack-cli**'s [`migrate`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli#migration-from-webpack-v1-to-v2) 
command and documenting the steps to resolve this [issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/issues/166), which is to document the migration process for developers.

## Objectives
The objectives of this repo will be a "live" aid to support the goal of documenting the migration process.  The steps will include:

1.  A basic JavaScript "Hello World" example (to verify the before / after)
1.  Using a single [webpack 1](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) based configration reflecting common development and production configuration options
1.  Running the migration tast against that configuration
1.  Documenting the results in [MIGRATE.md](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/blob/master/MIGRATE.md) in a fork
1.  Submitting a PR
1.  ???
1.  Profit
